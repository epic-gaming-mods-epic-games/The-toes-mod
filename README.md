# Building

It is pretty simple because this mod uses Gradle to build.

To build this mod yourself you will need:
1. Java 8 or higher: https://java.com/en/download/
2. The source code for this mod.
3. (Optional) Git, to get the code to the desktop the nerd way.

Now the instructions

1. Open Powershell/CMD
2. cd to the folder you downloaded the source
3. Type or copy: ./gradlew.bat build --no-daemon
4. Hit enter.
5. Now go inside of The-toes-mod/build/libs to get the version, get the one WITHOUT -dev or -sources unless you want them, of course.
6. Add to Fabric mods folder
